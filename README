Design Goals

* Reduced dependencies: Checks for optional packages and only creates the fields if they are there.

* Rich content embedding from GUI: For embedded content, the markup language's GUI can do everything it needs.

* Flexible dependencies: Can pick from several applications that provide similar service, for example django-staff vs. User, massmedia vs. photologue

* Revision tracking: Keeps track of saved versions and allows a user to revert to a previous version.

* Related items: Can set any configured item to be related to the story. These are for Photos, Videos, other stories, etc.
